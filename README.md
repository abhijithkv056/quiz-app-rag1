Note few points:
1. so the prod branch  has secret keys fetched from streamlit secret key manager and not from my git hub acc-- So code for fetching API key is a bit differnt in app.py file

2. In local branch --> open API key is fetched from env variable

Internal note:
To run the code locally -- use the llms_v4 venv (all dependencies already set up there) i have defined and use the branch local (not main)
